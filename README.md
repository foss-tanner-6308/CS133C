# CS133C
Fall 2019 CS133C MWF 12pm

Design:
The assignment was to create a program that would define and print the seven primitive data types. The lessons of the week were about input and output.

Testing:
data type    input   expected output     actual output
short        30450          ?               30450
int          9              9               9
long         9999          9999             9999
char         t              t               t
float        3.14           3.14            3.140000    (formatted in final version)
double       .1424529515    0.14            .142453     (I assumed it would round to 2)

Reflection:
The only problem I had was I used GeekforGeeks to find the format specifiers and I initially misinterpreted the information which didn't "click" in my head until I stared at it for a couple minutes. I use VScode and it was very difficult to figure out how to get it to compile and print the program, but thankfully Alex helped me with that. Class time helped me approach the problem because we did in-depth examples on Friday during our lab time. I imagine it is related to future projects considering printing is a big part of entry level coding.
