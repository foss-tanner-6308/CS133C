Hangman-like game

Define the "letter bank" (each letter in the alphabet)
Define incorrect guesses that the user gets

User 1 enter the secret word to be guessed by user 2
Count number of characters in word and display number to user 2 with underscores ("_ _ _ _ _")
User 2 begin guessing letters

If correct letter, display where letter appears in word (such as "_ _ _ l _")
Do not increase incorrect guesses

If incorrect letter, tell user 2 that the letter is not in the word
Increase incorrect guesses by 1

Repeat until user 2 either guesses word or gets 5ish incorrect guesses

If user correctly guesses word, print winner message, have eternal glory

If user does not guess word, inform user they did not guess it correctly,
print the correct word, have eternal damnation

Ask if user would like to play again

Note: if using the underscores to represent the letters is too difficult,
      I will have the program tell the user how many letters are in the word
      and if they guess a letter correctly then the program will say which
      spot that letter is in.
