I apologize for the massive jpg of the design, I'm not sure why it turned out that way but it
definitely did not start like that. I like to write out the design in pseudocode to have a 
sort of list to follow going from step to step. It keeps me from feeling overwhelmed with the
assignments by breaking it down into pieces that I can figure out and put together as I go along.
